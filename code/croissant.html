                        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar, salt, and instant yeast.</li>
                        <li>Add the softened butter, water, and milk to the dry ingredients.</li>
                        <li>Mix until a dough forms, then knead for about 10 minutes until smooth and elastic.</li>
                        <li>Cover the dough with plastic wrap and let it rest in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour.</li>

                    <ol class="order-list">
                        <b><li>1. Laminate the Dough:</b>
                          <ul class="list">
                            <li>On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough into a rectangle about 1/2 inch thick.</li>
                            <li>Place the 250 grams of cold butter between two pieces of parchment paper and pound it with a rolling pin into a rectangle about 1/4 inch thick.</li>
                            <li>Remove the top parchment paper and place the butter sheet on the lower third of the dough rectangle.</li>
                            <li>Fold the dough over the butter so it is completely encased. Seal the edges.</li>
                            <li>Roll the dough into a long rectangle, then fold it into thirds (like a letter).</li>
                            <li>Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and chill for 1 hour. Repeat the rolling and folding process two more times, chilling for at least 1 hour between each turn.</li>
                          </ul>
                        </li>

                          <ul class="list">
                            <li>Roll the dough out to a rectangle about 1/4 inch thick.</li>
                            <li>Cut the dough into long triangles with a base of about 5 inches.</li>
                            <li>Roll each triangle tightly from the base to the tip to form a croissant shape, ensuring the tip is tucked under the bottom of the croissant to prevent it from unrolling during baking.</li>
                            <li>Place the shaped croissants on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, leaving space between each for expansion.</li>
                            <li>Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let them rise in a warm place until nearly doubled in size, about 1 to 2 hours.</li>
                          </ul>
                        </li>

                          <ul class="list">
                            <li>Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).</li>
                            <li>Beat the egg with a tablespoon of water and brush it over the croissants to give them a shiny, golden finish.</li>
                            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 15-20 minutes or until they are golden brown and puffed up.</li>
                            <li>Let the croissants cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>

                    Eat your freshly baked croissants warm, ideally the same day they are baked for the best texture and flavor. Cofee or tea is recommended for a fantastic combination.
